### Keep your fork up to date

- git remote -v
- git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
- git remove -v (again, to check if it has been added)
- git pull origin master

- other method(official from git): https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork
